# Diamond Analysis and Price Prediction using Random Forest
## Summary
This project aims to find all the details about the diamond dataset and what possibly affects its price. Finally, it tries to predict the diamond's price based on the correlated variables. The project includes:
- Data Cleaning
- Univariate Analysis
- Hypothesis Testing to re-assure the relationship among variables 
- Bivariate Analysis
- Multivariate Analysis
- Diamond's Price Prediction using Random Forest

## Explain the techniques used in the project:
- Data Cleaning
  In this step, I removed:
   Unnecessary column
   Duplicated rows
   Inappropriate values
  I also used the MICE method to impute the missing values of the dataset
