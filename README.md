# Diamond Analysis and Price Prediction using Random Forest
## Summary
This project aims to find all the details about the diamond dataset and what possibly affects its price. Finally, it tries to predict the diamond's price based on the correlated variables. The project includes:
- Data Cleaning
- Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Multivariate Analysis
- Diamond's Price Prediction using Random Forest
